      <p>Hi there! I am an incoming MS in Quantitative Economics candidate at <a
        href="https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/quantitative-economics.html"
        target="_blank">NYU, Stern School of Business</a>. Until then, I will be finishing up my bachelor's degree in Honours in Economics at <a
        href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/faculties/desautels/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-commerce-bcom-honours-economics"
        target="_blank">McGill University</a>, in Montreal, Canada. My main research interests lie in microeconomics, economic networks and econometrics. 
        I'm also particularly interested in applications to labour and development economics.
        <br></br>
    
        In the Fall of 2022, I worked as a part-time Research Assistant to Prof. Hassan Benchekroun at McGill University, 
        focusing on the private provision of public goods, in the context of charitable fundraising. 
        Prior to that, I worked at
        <a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/"
        target="_blank">The Decision Lab</a>, a behavioural-science think tank and consulting firm. As a summer associate, I contributed to a 
        consulting project whose purpose was to reduce alcohol abuse in South Africa through behavioural nudges. 
        <br></br>
    
        Here are some short essays I've written on Arrow's <a href="socialchoice.pdf" target="_blank">impossibility theorem</a>, and the history of <a href="gametheory.pdf" target="_blank">game theory</a>.
        <br></br>

        Outside of work, I spend most of my time playing the classical guitar, 
        listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rijuSUZo-w0&ab_channel=60otaku4"
        target="_blank">jazz</a>, sketching trees and hiking with my partner,
        <a href="https://rashalama.com/"
        target="_blank">Rasha</a>.
