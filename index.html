      <p>I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor Degree in Economics at <a
        href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/faculties/desautels/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-commerce-bcom-honours-economics"
        target="_blank">McGill University</a> located in Montreal, Canada. My program has mainly touched on
        macroeconomics, microeconomics, the history of economic thought, and has allowed me to develop skills in game theory and econometrics.
        I'm also particularly interested in behavioural economics and market design.
        <br></br>

        My most recent professional experience was at
        <a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/"
        target="_blank">The Decision Lab</a>, a behavioural science think tank and consulting firm. As a summer associate, I worked on a 
        consulting project whose purpose was to reduce alcohol abuse through behavioural nudges. 
        <br></br>

        Outside of work, I spend most of my time playing the classical guitar, listening to jazz, sketching trees and hiking with my partner,
