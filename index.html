      <p>I'm currently finishing up my bachelor degree in Honours in Economics at <a
        href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/faculties/desautels/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-commerce-bcom-honours-economics"
        target="_blank">McGill University</a> located in Montreal, Canada. My main research interests lie in game theory, microeconomics and public economics. 
        I'm also particularly interested in applications to development economics and welfare economics.
        <br></br>
    
        I've recently begun working as a part-time Research Assitant to Prof. Hassan Benchekroun at McGill University, 
        focusing on voluntary contributions to public good games, in the context of charitable fundraising. 
        Prior to that, my most recent professional experience was at
        <a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/"
        target="_blank">The Decision Lab</a>, a behavioural science think tank and consulting firm. As a summer associate, I worked on a 
        consulting project whose purpose was to reduce alcohol abuse in South Africa through behavioural nudges. 
        <br></br>
    
        Here are some short essays I've written on Arrow's <a href="socialchoice.pdf" target="_blank">impossibility theorem</a>, the history of <a href="gametheory.pdf" target="_blank">game theory</a> and the ethics of <a href="marketdesign.pdf"
        target="_blank">market design</a>.
        <br></br>

        Outside of work, I spend most of my time playing the classical guitar, listening to jazz, sketching trees and hiking with my partner,
