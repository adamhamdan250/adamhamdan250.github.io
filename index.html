      <p>Hi. I am currently an MSc in quantitative economics candidate at <a
        href="https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/quantitative-economics.html"
        target="_blank">NYU, Stern</a>. Before this, I finished my undergrad in economics at <a
        href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/faculties/desautels/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-commerce-bcom-honours-economics"
        target="_blank">McGill University</a>. 
        I am broadly interested in microeconomic theory, and <a href="dynamicnetworks.pdf" target="_blank"> economic networks</a>.
        <br></br>
      
        During my most recent internship, I worked at
        <a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/"
        target="_blank">The Decision Lab</a>, a behavioural-science think tank and consulting firm. As a summer associate, I contributed to a 
        consulting project whose purpose was to reduce alcohol abuse in South Africa through behavioural nudges.
        <br></br>

        Outside of work, I spend my time playing the classical guitar, 
        listening to lots of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rijuSUZo-w0&ab_channel=60otaku4"
        target="_blank">jazz</a>, sketching trees, and hiking with my partner,
        <a href="https://rashalama.com/"
        target="_blank">Rasha</a>.
