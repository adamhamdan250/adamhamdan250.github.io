      <p> Ranking Teams (2023) <br>
      
      Abstract: A principal wishes to rank and reward teams in an organization, modelled by cliques in a graph. Agents in          the organizational network perfectly observe the ranking of the teams they are part of and can report on the local           ranking of their teams. We show that the only network structures that guarantee a complete ranking of teams are the          triangle and the star graph. Unless the organizational network is a triangle or a star, the principal cannot design an       ex-post incentive compatible and efficient team ranking mechanism. </p>
